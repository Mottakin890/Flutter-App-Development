  // This code demonstrates how to manipulate a list in Dart by adding and removing elements, and checking the length of the list.
  // Lists in Dart are dynamic, meaning you can add or remove elements at runtime.
  // The `add` method is used to append an element to the end of the list, while the `remove` method is used to delete a specific element.
  // The `length` property returns the number of elements in the list.
  // This is a simple example of how to work with lists in Dart, showcasing basic operations like adding, removing, and counting elements.
  // Lists are a fundamental data structure in Dart, allowing you to store and manipulate collections of items efficiently.
  // This code is a simple demonstration of list manipulation in Dart, showcasing how to add, remove, and count elements in a list.
  // Lists are versatile and can hold any type of data, making them a powerful tool for managing collections in Dart applications.
  // Lists are dynamic in Dart, meaning you can change their size and contents at runtime.
